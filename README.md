# Fake_News_Detect🧐
This GitHub repository is for our MTH2253 course research on 'How social media spreads misinformation?'. The repository showcases the models we trained and the datasets we used.

# The first model is named (img_fake_detect)🖼
it uses the naive bayes algorithm to predict the probability that news is fake given that it has no image

# The second model is named (text_fake_detect)📝
Using the power of NLP and TF-IDF, it predicts whether news is fake by processing its text

# To run the two models:
  1- Unzip the datasets files 
  2- run the code of the two models

# Screenshot of the confusion matrix of the fake_text_model
